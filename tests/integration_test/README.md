# Integration Tests
This document will describe how to do integration tests will be implemented in this repo.

As mentioned in unit test document you use functions stubbing. In this integration test the function stubbing is not needed. There you can test function that calls other function and test if the function works correctly.

The other thing that you will do is, wheather the componente works correctly in a bigger evironment. For the SQL Example check if it can be used from another context.
